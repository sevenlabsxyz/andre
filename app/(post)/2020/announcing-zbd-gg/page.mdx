> Three weeks ago we announced the Public Beta release of the [ZEBEDEE Mobile Wallet](https://zbd.gg) for iOS and Android platforms. Today, we’re happy to report that after some bug-fixing and lots of great feedback from our awesome community of testers, ZEBEDEE Wallet is now live on the Google Play Store! We expect an iOS App Store release to follow in the coming weeks — in the meantime download the TestFlight version here.
