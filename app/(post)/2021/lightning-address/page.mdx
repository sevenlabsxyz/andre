      Introducing the{" "}
      <a href="https://lightningaddress.com">Lightning Address</a> protocol
    </span>
  }
/>

I created the Lightning Address protocol to empower everyone to send money like we send emails — instantly and abundantly. Coupled with the Lightning Network’s ability to send Bitcoin instantly and with (almost) no fees, I'm ushering in a new standard for how value moves around the world.

**Easy and familiar**

No more requesting invoices and scanning QR codes to send your friends Bitcoin. If you can send an email, you can send a transaction to a Lightning Address.

**Extended functionality**

Set minimum and maximum payment sizes to accept, add images and comments to your transactions, and more features that weren't possible before.

**Sets your money free**

Your friend uses a different app or wallet? No problem! This is a new standard designed to break the barriers between Lightning providers. We all speak Bitcoin.

After the announcement, the protocol quickly gained traction and is now bar none standard on how to provide the best UX for payments across services and providers in the Bitcoin space. **Every wallet and app in the market now has support for some version of Lightning Address.**
