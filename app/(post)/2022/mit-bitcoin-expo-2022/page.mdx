I was part of the Bitcoin Expo 2022 track where I gave a presentation about the [Lightning Address](/2021/lightning-address).

In the talk I compared it to SMTP and showed the power of standardized protocols/open APIs that every company and/or individual can follow to become part of the network.

The ability for Gmail to send and receive from Outlook or Proton is key. We want the same "experience" for other parts of the internet stack -- predominantly MONEY.

Why can't you send money from your Chase account to your Spotify account? Really think about it!
