> If money is to be digital, instantaneous, and global, then it must also be interoperable.

This is not our reality. We live in a non-interoperable financial world. A world where global wire transfers between banks get stuck for over 3 weeks. A world where fintechs and neobanks promise interoperability but give you more proprietary APIs. A world where we canâ€™t send money from Cash App to Revolut.

**It is 2022, and we must do better.**

What if there was another way? What if the payment rails were instead built on money that was inherently interoperable at the base layer? What if users enjoyed fee-less, instantaneous transactions with one another on a global scale, regardless of provider choice?

The future of payments must be built on true global interoperability across users and providers that rely on the same base money - Bitcoin.
