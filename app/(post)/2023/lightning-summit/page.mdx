ZBD was invited to give a talk at [The Power of Lightning Summit](https://www.meetup.com/bitcoinpark/events/294855711/) that occurred at Bitcoin Park in Nashville in 2023. I gave a talk about **cubes** and how open source technologies should be seen as building blocks by developers/builders. I discussed how Zaps are made out of Nostr and Lightning Address, and how Lightning Address is made of combination of DNS and LNURL, and how LNURL itself is Lightning + HTTP. These are all building blocks that lead to innovations and products/services with different expertises/trade-offs.

ZBD's VP of Infrastructure, Michael Tidwell, and ZBD's Lead Lightning Engineer, Richard Safier, were in 2 panels about advancements in Bitcoin and Lightning Network. ZBD's CSO Ben Cousens was on a panel discussing Lightning's usage and place in the video gaming industry. And ZBD's VP of Brand was on a panel about the most important aspects of onboarding newcomers into Nostr and Lightning.
