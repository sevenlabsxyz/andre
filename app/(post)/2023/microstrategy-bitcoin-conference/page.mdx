In early 2023 I was invited to give a presentation about ZBD at the MicroStrategy Bitcoin Conference. Specifically MicroStrategy team was hoping to show the latest and greatest of platforms and systems for Enterprise customers.

In my presentation I was able to show how adding ZBD Rewards to games, studios are able to see giant uplifts to their retention curves, thus leading to much larger customer LTV and monetization touch points.

[Bitcoin Miner by Fumb Games](https://twitter.com/BTCMinerApp) is the largest "web3" title in the market, they have well over 1M players, and by adding ZBD API for Bitcoin rewards, they increased D30 worldwide retention for users by over 1200%!!

**Bonus:** At the conference I spoke with Michael Saylor and he voiced how understanding [the Lightning Address](/2021/lightning-address) made him tell his VP of Eng. to turn every @microstrategy.com email into a Lightning Address as well. This was also the impetus for the Lightning Rewards for Corporations product that MicroStrategy announced at the conference.
