I was invited to return to [MIT Bitcoin Expo](https://www.mitbitcoinexpo.org/) to discuss Lightning Network and Nostr in 2023. Whereas my focus in [2022 was on the Lightning Address](/2022/mit-bitcoin-expo-2022), this time around I was discussing the compounding effects of two decentralized open protocols (money + communications) that can complement one another.

I also went over all the initiatives that [NBD](https://nbd.wtf) has undertaken over the past year, and where our focus area will continue to be at.
