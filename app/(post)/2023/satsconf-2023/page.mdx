ZBD had presence at [SatsConf 2023](https://satsconf.com.br) in Sao Paulo, Brazil this past November. Multiple team members had presentations and panels, including my talk on "Building the Future Now: Compounding Effects of Bitcoin and Nostr".

_P.S. All of our dope limited edition merch got sold out!_

ZBD had a beast "Instagram Wall" designed by Brianna d'Estries, ZBD's VP of Brand, that became a central point for photos of the conference goers.

The [Vinteum](https://vinteum.org) team was also all-hands-on-deck at [SatsConf](https://satsconf.com.br), and so both Bruno Garcia, Bitcoin Core dev and Vinteum's Head of Education, as well as Davidson Souza, Vinteum grantee, spoke in a panel about their paths as developers and how they arrived at "working for Bitcoin full time" now.
