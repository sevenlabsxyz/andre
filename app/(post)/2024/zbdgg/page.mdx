I am delighted to share that [ZBD](https://zbd.gg) has released a brand new website -- [zbd.gg](https://zbd.gg).

# [zbd.gg](https://zbd.gg)

[zbd.gg](https://zbd.gg) is now your entry point for all things ZBD, whether you are a user, developer, business partner, or just a Bitcoin enthusiast. Whether you're looking to play games and earn Bitcoin, or you're searching for how to integrate in-game money and rewards, ZBD has got your back.

We also display some of our favorite ZBD App extensions:

- Add **[ZBD Discord Bot](https://zbd.gg/z/bots)** to your server
- Add **[ZBD Telegram Bot](https://zbd.gg/z/bots)** to your server
- Bring ZBD to the desktop with the **[ZBD Browser Extension](https://zbd.gg/z/browser-extension)**

To appeal the inner developer in me (and in you!) we flipped to a cooler dark theme for our developer-facing product pages. Learn about ZBD's APIs and SDKs, all of our global payment capabilities, and how your game or application can leverage our technology to enhance its experience.

We also have a brand new product being rolled out to beta partners called [ZBD Rewards SDK](https://zbd.gg/z/rewards-sdk). It's a plug-and-play solution for any mobile game (or app) built using Unity to add in-game rewards within minutes. It is fully managed, which means once its integrated there's no ongoing work needed to maintain -- ZBD handles all of the regulation, compliance, payment provisioning, sending of the rewards, and all of the infrastructure necessary.

Focus on always improving the experience for your users, and let ZBD handle the heavy lifting around global in-game money rewards powered by Bitcoin.

I'll do a deeper dive into ZBD Rewards SDK in a following post. [Hit me up at andre@zbd.gg if you'd like to be a part of the beta](mailto:andre@zbd.gg).

[zbd.dev](https://zbd.dev) is now your entry point for all API and SDK documentation, guides and knowledge base articles, as well as full-blown courses taught by ZBD's finest.

If you're just starting out with ZBD API, check out our [NextJS/React QuickStart](https://zbd.dev/docs/nextjs-quickstart), our [Rust QuickStart](https://zbd.dev/docs/rust-quickstart), or our base [HTTP QuickStart](https://zbd.dev/docs/http-quickstart) guides.

Game developers need to look no further than our thorough [Rewarded Play 101](https://zbd.dev/courses/rewarded-play/introduction) to learn the ins and outs of how in-game Bitcoin rewards can tremendously boost your game's KPIs and user retention.

[zbd.dev is fully open source, available on GitHub, and we welcome contributions!](https://github.com/zebedeeio/zbd-docs)

> _P.S. - Important to note the ZBD API still points to `api.zebedee.io`. We will work with all ZBD API developers to ensure any incoming changes or migrations do not affect business operations._

# ZBD no EE?

You may have noticed that we dropped the vowels -- the E's from our name "ZEBEDEE". We already used "ZBD" as a sub-logo for the company, and when pronounced in American English, ZEBEDEE sounds like `zee-bee-dee` (or Z-B-D). This felt like a natural evolution of the ZBD brand to further consolidate user experiences for B2B and B2C customers.

# Tech Stack

The zbd.gg website is unfortunately not open source -- we have a ton of proprietary stuff around the zbd.gg domain itself, so open sourcing "parts of the codebase" can be quite cumbersome.

In the absence of actual source code, I figured I'd just briefly walk through the tech stack of choice for us:

- [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/) - most comprehensive and out-of-the-box-feature-rich server and client framework for web dev
- [React](https://react.dev/) - UI layer
- [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/) - the single best animation library for modern web/React development
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) - utility-first CSS framework that can be composed to build any component design
- [Shadcn-UI](https://ui.shadcn.com/) - utility for building one's own component library on top of prebuilt Tailwind components
- [React Spring](https://www.react-spring.dev/) - another great animation lib for React

# Easter Eggs

We hid a handful of sexy easter eggs for those who can appreciate this sort of thing. Try and find them and share them with [@zbdapp](https://twitter.com/zbdapp) on Twitter!

> _HINT: ZBD makes it rain Bitcoin!_

Shout out to all of the ZBD team members, developer partners, and other stakeholders that put blood sweat and tears behind this project.

Lots more still to come, but [zbd.gg](https://zbd.gg) and [zbd.dev](https://zbd.dev) are your portals into the world of Bitcoin-powered Interactive Entertainment experiences.
